# Hotel Management System App

A simple Hotel Property Management System (PMS) desktop application built with C#, WinForms, and Entity Framework Core.  
The goal of this project was to apply modern .NET development techniques while keeping the structure understandable and approachable for entry-level development.

---

## Technologies Used

- **C# (.NET 8)**
- **WinForms (UI Layer)**
- **Entity Framework Core (ORM)**
- **LINQ**
- **Generics**
- **Reflection**
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**
- **MySQL (Database)**
- **Layered Architecture (UI Layer / Data Access Layer separation)**


---

## Entity Framework Core (EF Core)

The project uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to manage communication with a MySQL database.

**EF Core Features Used:**

- **Code-first approach:**  
  The database schema was created and updated through C# entity classes and EF Core Migrations. The database is generated by applying the migrations to the MySQL server.

- **DbContext & DbSets:**  
  A dedicated `HotelDbContext` class is used to handle all interactions with the database.

- **LINQ Queries:**  
  LINQ is used extensively for querying data, making the code more readable and maintainable.

- **Migrations Support:**  
  Although the project started with a pre-existing database, EF Core Migrations can be easily enabled for future schema changes.

- **Provider:**  
  The application uses the `Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql` provider to connect EF Core with MySQL.

## Use of Dependency Injection (DI)

**Specifically:**

- **Service Registration in Program.cs:**  
  All the required services and the DbContext are registered inside the Program.cs file using the default .NET Generic Host and DI Container.

- **Constructor Injection:**  
  Services like CustomerService, RoomService, etc., are injected directly into WinForms Forms via constructor parameters.

- **Benefits:**  
  This makes the application more testable, reduces coupling, and follows modern dependency management patterns even inside a desktop WinForms app.

- **Example Scenario:**  
  When opening a form like CustomerForm, the necessary service is automatically injected by the DI container, avoiding manual instantiation.

---

## Use of Reflection and Generics

A small but meaningful use of Reflection is present inside the `BaseService` class.

**Specifically:**

- **Dynamic Property Access:**  
  Reflection is used to dynamically retrieve the value of a given property from an object at runtime. This helps reduce boilerplate code when performing generic operations across different entities.

- **Example Scenario:**  
  This technique is applied in a generic filtering method that dynamically inspects filter form properties (marked with custom attributes) and builds LINQ queries to filter any entity type.

This was mainly implemented to experiment with Reflection and understand its use in real-world scenarios.

---

## Layered Architecture

The project follows a basic layered architecture with a clear separation between:

- **UI Layer (WinForms):**  
  Contains all the forms, user interface logic, and the service classes that handle business logic and data manipulation.  
  *(For simplicity and learning purposes, the service classes are placed inside the UI Layer rather than having a dedicated Business Logic Layer.)*

- **Data Access Layer:**  
  Contains the EF Core `DbContext` and the entity models.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **.NET 8 SDK**

- **Visual Studio 2022 or later**  
  (Make sure to include the .NET desktop development workload)

- **A supported Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**  
  The project currently uses MySQL, but thanks to EF Core's flexibility, it can work with others (like SQL Server, PostgreSQL).  
  *(You’ll need to adjust the connection string and provider packages if you switch.)*

- **MySQL Server**  
  Example: MySQL Community Server (or tools like MySQL Workbench for managing your DB)

- **Entity Framework Core Tools (with MySQL support)**

You need the following EF Core NuGet packages:

| Package Name                      | Installation via NuGet Package Manager          | Installation via CLI                           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore     | Search: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore           | `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`     |
| Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql  | Search: Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql        | `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql`  |
| Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools| Search: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools    | `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` |
| Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design| Search: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design  | `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` |

Alternatively, install all via CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
EF Core CLI tools (optional but recommended for database commands like migrations):
```

## Final Notes  
This project was built as part of my personal learning journey into .NET development, desktop app design, and database-driven applications.
It focuses on clean code, separation of concerns, and trying out advanced features like EF Core, LINQ, and Reflection, even at an entry level.
